# Control Flow
# A program will run (wake up) and start moving through its checklists,
# is this condition met,
# is that condition met,
# okay let’s execute this code and return that value.

# boolean is an expression that is True or False
# ie. "Saturday is the best day" = "No" "Saturday starts with 'S'" = "Yes"

# Relational operators compare two items and return either True or False.
# For this reason, you will sometimes hear them called comparators.
# == Equals
# != Not equals

# 1 == 1 / True
# 2 != 4 / True
# 3 == 5 / False

# True and False are the only bool types, and any variable that is assigned one of these values is called a boolean variable.
# ie. set_to_true = True, set_to_false = False
# ie. bool_one = 5 != 7, bool_two = 1 + 1 != 2, bool_three = 3 * 3 == 9

# Boolean / Logical Operators
# the conditions you want to check in your conditional statement
# will require more than one boolean expression to cover.
# In these cases, you can build larger boolean expressions using boolean/logical operators.
# and - combines two boolean expressions and evaluates as True if both its components are True, but False otherwise.
# or - combines two expressions into a larger expression that is True if EITHER component is True.
# not - when applied to any boolean expression it reverses the boolean value. True statement + a not operator = a False statement.

# REVIEW
# Boolean expressions are statements that can be either True or False
# A boolean variable is a variable that is set to either True or False.
# We can create boolean expressions using relational operators:
# ==: Equals
# !=: Not equals
# >: Greater than
# >=: Greater than or equal to
# <: Less than
# <=: Less than or equal to
# if statements can be used to create control flow in your code.
# else statements can be used to execute code when the conditions of an if statement are not met.
# elif statements can be used to build additional checks into your if statements
